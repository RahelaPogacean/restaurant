I developed a simulation system for a restaurant which has 3 types of users: administrator, waiter and chef. From the main
frame of the app, you can choose the user "role" by pressing a button. As an administrator, you'll have your own "page" and 
you'll be able to create a new item (base or composite), delete or edit an item. Each operation can be done by pressing a button
and the user is also allowed to clean the fields (Reset) or to come back to the main page. One important advantage is that you 
have the possibility to see the list with all the products and the modifications done. The waiter page is aimed to place and 
honor an order. You just have to enter the order ID, the table number, select the desired products from list and the details 
related to the current order will be displayed.
